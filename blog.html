                        working with over the past several weeks which was my favorite part. The house I stayed at was a cute place along the river and had
                        deer roaming everywhere. I'm glad to be back home though, Texas heat is BRUTAL.</p>

                        I got a pastry to snack on then I was torn between the many art stands I wanted to buy from. I ended up
                        getting this cute little plant that has leaves which will react when you touch them. I also got this handmade plant hanger.
                        I'll definitely be returning soon for food and more handmade products.</p>
